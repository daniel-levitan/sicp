; In 1737, the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler published a memoir De Fractionibus Continuis, which
; included a continued fraction expansion for e - 2, where e is the base of the natural logarithms.
; In this fraction, the  Ni are all 1, and the Di are successively 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8, ....
; Write a program that uses your cont-frac procedure from Exercise 1.37 to approximate e, based on Eulerâ€™s expansion.

(define (cont-frac n d k)
  (define (term i)
    (cond ((= k i) (/ (n i) (d i)))
          (else (/ (n i) (+ (d i) (term (+ i 1))))) ))
  (term 1))


(define (d i)
  (if (= 0 (remainder (+ i 1) 3)) 
      (* 2 (+ (quotient i 3) 1))
      1))

(+ 2 (cont-frac (lambda (i) 1.0)
                d
                10))
