; In software-testing applications, it is useful to be able to count the number of times a given procedure
; is called during the course of a computation. Write a procedure make-monitored that takes as input a procedure, f,
; that itself takes one input. The result returned by makemonitored is a third procedure, say mf, that keeps track
; of the number of times it has been called by maintaining an internal counter. If the input to mf is the special symbol
; how-many-calls?, then mf returns the value of the counter. If the input is the special symbol reset-count, then mf resets
; the counter to zero. For any other input, mf returns the result of calling f on that input and increments the counter.
; For instance, we could make a monitored version of the sqrt procedure:
; (define s (make-monitored sqrt))
; (s 100)
; 10
; (s 'how-many-calls?)
; 1

(define (square x) (* x x))

(define (make-monitored f)
  (let ((counter 0))
    (define (dispatch m)
      (if (eq? m 'how-many-calls?)
          counter
          (begin (set! counter (+ counter 1))
                       (f m))))
    dispatch))  ; Isso é o que eu devolvo

(define s (make-monitored square))

(s 'how-many-calls?)
(s 10)
(s 'how-many-calls?)
(map s '(1 2 3 4 5))
(s 'how-many-calls?)
