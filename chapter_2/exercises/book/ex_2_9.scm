; The width of an interval is half of the difference between its upper and lower bounds. The width is a
; measure of the uncertainty of the number specified by the interval. For some arithmetic operations the width of the
; result of combining two intervals is a function only of the widths of the argument intervals, whereas for others the
; width of the combination is not a function of the widths of the argument intervals. Show that the width of the sum (or
; difference) of two intervals is a function only of the widths of the intervals being added (or subtracted). Give examples
; to show that this is not true for multiplication or division.
