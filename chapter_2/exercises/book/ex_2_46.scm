#lang simply-scheme

; A two-dimensional vector v running from the origin to a point can be represented as a pair consisting
; of an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate. Implement a data abstraction for vectors by giving a constructor make-vect
; and corresponding selectors xcor-vect and ycor-vect. In terms of your selectors and constructor, implement procedures
; add-vect, sub-vect, and scale-vect that perform the operations vector addition, vector subtraction, and multiplying
; a vector by a scalar:

; (x1, y1) + (x2, y2) = (x1 + x2, y1 + y2)
; (x1, y1) - (x2, y2) = (x1 - x2, y1 - y2)
; s Â· (x, y) = (sx, sy)
